# javascript and classes

Q.1- Do javaScript really have classes?

JavaScript does have a concept called "classes" introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), but it's important to note that JavaScript's classes are syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system. JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance is different from the class-based inheritance found in some other languages like Java or C++.

The class syntax in JavaScript provides a more convenient and familiar way to define constructor functions and prototype methods. It doesn't introduce classical class-based inheritance like in Java. Instead, it uses prototypes to achieve a form of object-oriented programming.

## OOP - Object oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to organize code. In JavaScript, OOP is achieved through the use of objects, prototypes, and the prototype chain. While JavaScript is a prototype-based language, it supports object-oriented programming principles.

Here are key concepts related to OOP in JavaScript:
1.Objects
2.Prototypes
3.

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
